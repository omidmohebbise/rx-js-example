# RxJS Library README

## Overview

RxJS is a powerful library for reactive programming using Observables. It allows you to work with asynchronous data streams and provides a wide range of operators to manipulate, filter, and combine these streams. This README provides a brief introduction to RxJS and includes an example demonstrating the creation and usage of an Observable.

## Getting Started

To use RxJS in your project, you need to install it using npm:

```bash
npm install rxjs
```
## Example Usage
Consider the following example that creates an Observable emitting a sequence of numbers and subscribes to it:

```
// Import the necessary RxJS modules
const { Observable } = require("rxjs");

let sequenceCount = 5;

// Create an Observable that emits a sequence of numbers
const numberObservable = new Observable((observer) => { 
  for (let i = 0; i < sequenceCount; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {      
      observer.next(i);
      if (i === (sequenceCount - 1)) {
        observer.complete();
      }
    }, 1000 * i);
  }
});

// Subscribe to the Observable and log each emitted value
const subscription = numberObservable.subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log(`Next value: ${value}`),
  error: (error) => console.error(`Error: ${error}`),
  complete: () => console.log("Observable complete"),
});

// After some time, unsubscribe to stop receiving notifications
setTimeout(() => {
  subscription.unsubscribe();
  console.log("Unsubscribed");
}, sequenceCount * 1000);
```

In this example, an Observable is created using the Observable class, and a sequence of numbers is emitted with a one-second delay between each emission. The subscribe method is used to listen to the emitted values, handle errors, and recognize when the Observable is complete. Finally, the subscription is unsubscribed after a certain period to stop receiving notifications.
